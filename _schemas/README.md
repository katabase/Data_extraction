# Schemas

This repository contains all the schemas used for the encoding of the catalogues.

## 1. schema_grobid_output

+ The RELAX NG schena is used to assess each GROBID dictionaries output and correct structure inaccuracies. 

## 2. odd_katabase

+ The XML document (still in progress) will eventually document the whole project.

+ The RELAX NG schema odd_katabase.rng can validate every XML document available on Katabase (manuscript descriptions, manuscripts sales catalogs, etc.). This schema is used for the validation of every encoded catalogue.
